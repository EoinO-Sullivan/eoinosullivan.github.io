Once ignited, peatland fires may smolder for months spewing out smoke, toxic fumes, and carbon dioxide. This phenomenon occurs across a diversity of regions such as Indonesia, Canada, Australia, and Siberia. With fire frequency expected to increase under climate change, the carbon released would be significant for the global climateâ€“carbon cycle. Heat produced by microbial respiration is thought to be a key contributor, and this is the basis of the 'Compost-Bomb' instability, a theorized runaway heating of peat soils when atmospheric temperature rises faster than some critical rate, first proposed in [Luke & Cox, European Journal of Soil Science (2011), 62.1] and analysed in [Wieczorek et al, Proceedings of the Royal Society A (2011), 467.2129].

Here, the original soil carbon-temperature model of Luke & Cox is augmented with a non-monotonic microbial respiration function, for a more realistic process representation. This gives rise to a meta-stable state, reproducing the results of [Khvorostyanov et al, Tellus (2008), 60B] where a complex PDE model is used. Two non-autonomous climate forcings are examined: (i) a rise in mean air temperature over decades (ii) a short-lived extreme weather event, with the rate-induced compost bomb observed in each. Using techniques of compactification, singular perturbation and rate-induced tipping, we reduce the compost-bomb problem to one of heteroclinic orbits, uncovering the tipping mechanism for each climate change scenario.
