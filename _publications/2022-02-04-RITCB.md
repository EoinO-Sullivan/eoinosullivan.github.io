Surface wildfires are generally believed to be the cause of so-called *Zombie fires* observed in peatlands, that disappear from the surface, smoulder underground during the winter, and ''come back to life" in the spring. Here, we propose rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) to a *subsurface* hot metastable state} in bioactive peat soils as a main cause of Zombie fires. Our hypothesis is based on a conceptual soil-carbon model
subjected to realistic changes in weather and climate patterns, including global warming scenarios and
summer heatwaves.


Mathematically speaking, R-tipping to the hot metastable state is a nonautonomous  instability, due to crossing an elusive *quasithreshold*, in a multiple timescale dynamical system. To explain this instability, we provide a
framework that combines a special compactification technique with concepts from geometric singular perturbation theory.
This framework allows us to reduce an R-tipping problem due to crossing a quasithreshold to a heteroclinic orbit problem in a singular limit. Thus, we
 identify generic cases of such  R-tipping via: (i) unfolding of a  codimension-two  *heteroclinic folded saddle-node  type-I singularity* for global warming, and (ii) analysis of a codimension-one *saddle-to-saddle hetroclinic orbit* for summer heatwaves, which in turn reveal new types of excitability quasithresholds.
